Jeff Probe
==========

This is a fork of the [original Black Magic Probe](https://github.com/blacksphere/blackmagic).

The original is arguably better, faster, and more widely supported. However, this 
project was a way to offer an affordable version and I'll rely on community
support and pull requests.

One arguably better function is the ability to do DEBUG and Serial communication
over a single JTAG cable when paired with a device that uses single wire JTAG.

Normally, the serial header can be used on a target for the serial port, and
shows up as the second serial device on the system, however, we can dynamically
change the pins to use the ones on the JTAG cable with the following command:

``` bash
 $ mon convert_tdio enable
```

Compilation
---

Newer toolchains can cause issues. I usually work 4_9-2014q4-20141203 found [here.](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/4.9/4.9-2014-q4-major/+download/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2014q4-20141203-mac.tar.bz2)


```bash
 $ make clean
 $ make PROBE_HOST=jeff CUSTOM_SER=1
 $ dfu-util --device ,1d50:6017 -s 0x00002000:leave -D src/blackmagic.bin 
```

CUSTOM OPTIONS
---

On mac, our device shows up with a serial number /dev/tty.cuJEFF123HDC 

This can be annoying if we want to auto connect with a gith script. We can override
the use of a serial number by doing a custom compilation such that our device
shows up as the following: `/dev/cu.usbmodemJEFF1`, or `/dev/cu.usbmodemJEFF3`

```bash
 $ make PROBE_HOST=jeff CUSTOM_SER=1
```
